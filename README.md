Hello,
I'm Guilherme, currently I am a Computer Science Master's student at Instituto Superior in Lisbon and a Security Engineer at Inspiring Solutions. I'm passionate about cybersecurity and have a knack for solving complex problems, especially in the realm of Cyber Security. I'm currently dedicated to my master's thesis, focusing on detecting vulnerabilities in code using static analysis techniques. Outside of academics, I'm an active individual who enjoys surfing, CrossFit, reading, traveling, and socializing with friends. My involvement in CTF events with STT showcases my practical skills and enthusiasm for cybersecurity challenges.
Head on over to [dashboard](pages/college/Dashboard.md) to see my projects.
