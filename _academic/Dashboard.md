> The projects are organized according to the corresponding study stage. Besides that, the projects I work on outside school will also be added here.

Click [here](Undergraduate.md) for my undegraduated projects.  

Click [here](Masters.md) for my masters projects.

Click [here](../writeups/README.md) for my writeups.

## Notes

Since I will be continuously updating this page with the new projects. I do not include links to the code, just a summary. For those interested in seeing my project's source contact me and I'll be happy to send you the source code (my contacts are [here](../../README.md))  
Both undergraduate page and Masters page show which subjects I enrolled in.
