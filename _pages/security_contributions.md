## Path-traversal in the NPM package `tal-page-strategies`

During my research as a master student at IST (in the year of 2024), I identified a vulnerability in the NPM package `tal-page-strategies`. The developers acknowledge my efforts and have awarded me a place in their [Hall of Fame](https://www.bbc.com/backstage/security-disclosure-policy/acknowledgements/).

This vulnerability has been submited to the **MITRE** platform and currently awaits a CVE identifier.
